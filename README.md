This repository contains Python solutions to coding problems, organized by difficulty level to support step-by-step learning.

### 🗂️ Folder Overview

* `easy/` — Basic problems using loops, conditions, and lists.
  Includes:
   2. You’re given an array A of n integers and q queries.Each query can be one of the following two types:Type 1 Query: (1, l, r) - Replace A[i] with(i-l+1)*A[l]
      for each index i, where l <= i <= r. Type 2 Query: (2, l, r) - Calculate the sum of theelements in A from index l to index r.Find the sum of answers to all type 2 queries.
      Since answer can be large, return it modulo 10^9+7.
